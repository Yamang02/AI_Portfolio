# Agent Signal Guidelines
**Purpose**: Core rules for AI Agent documentation triggers

## Core Principles
- Document only when: 1) Developer explicitly requests, OR 2) Commit is needed
- Never force content into templates
- Preserve natural development flow
- **Always respond in Korean** (한국어로 응답)

## Signal Detection

### Developer Requests
```
✅ Record when developer says:
- "기록해줘" / "정리해줘" / "커밋 전에 정리해줘"
- "이 결정사항을 기록해야겠어"
- "문서로 남겨줘" / "포트폴리오용으로 정리해줘"
```

### Commit Triggers
```
✅ Check when developer says:
- "커밋하자" / "저장하자"
- Code changes complete
- Feature implementation done
```

## Record Types
- **Session**: Goals, results, learnings, next steps
- **Decisions**: Background, options, chosen solution, impact
- **Learnings**: Concepts, applications, references
- **Problem-solving**: Issue, attempts, final solution, lessons

## Workflow
1. Detect signal → 2. Determine type → 3. Generate content → 4. Confirm & save → 5. Pre-commit check

## Don't Record
- General Q&A conversations
- Code explanations without request
- Template filling without clear purpose
- Automatic importance-based decisions

*Keep it simple. Follow signals. Document naturally. Respond in Korean.*
